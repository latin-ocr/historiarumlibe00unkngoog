· The text of Drakenborch has been adopted, as, on the
whole, of the highest authority3 but, Livy being the author
first read in our Colleges‚ care has been taken to conform the
orthography os those words which may be variously written,
to the Dictionaries and Grammars in common use. With a
similar regard to the condition of newly formed classes,
necessarily· consisting of individuals of different degree· of
proficiency‚ certain ambiguous words are distinguished by
accents3 but students should become accustomed to dispense
with these facilities in some part of their course, for modern
editions os the 'classice rarely afford them!

The notes, which are chiefly derived from the editions of
Miiller, Doering, and Ruperti, fill as much space as could well
be allowed to them in this edition, since it was thought best
not to exceed the size os the volume fo'r which this is pro-
posed as a substitute. In quantity, however, that volume is

omitted, e. g. satiS, magis, soepe. “ ontracted syllables are marked with
a circumflex; also the final syllable of the ablative of the first declen· '
sion‚'’ and this (contrary to Ruddiman) even when the governing prepo-
sition is expressed.
